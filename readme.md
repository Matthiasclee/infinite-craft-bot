# Infinite Craft Bot
This program uses the [Infinite Craft](https://neal.fun/infinite-craft/) API to discover new items.
<br>
Using this, I was able to discover a lot of items and recipes, including 84 new discoveries, however, Cloudflare started
filtering its requests, so I had to shut it down. This repo contains the results of everything I found.

## Stats
* Total recipes checked: 113,765 *Additional recipes checked after the API started filtering requests have been omitted.*
* Total unique items found: 6,114
* Total new discoveries: 84
